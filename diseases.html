                Four out of five adults will experience at least one bout of back pain at some time in their lives. Structurally backache is a condition that usually is caused when one or more structures of the back gets affected and these includes muscles, cartilage, bones or spinal cord.</div>
                  <div id="backpain2" class="col s12">
                    Triggering Factors -The episode of back ache might result either from a strenuous event or previous history. Even psycho-social risk factors like stress, distress, anxiety, depression, cognitive functioning, job dissatisfaction and mental stress can play a role in triggering back ache. There may be some deep underlying causes of low back pain, few of which include:<br><br>
                Fracture of vertebral bones. <br><br>
                Slipped disc; disc bulges out of vertebral joint and puts pressure on spinal nerves. <br><br>
                Spinal stenosis; owing to narrowing of spinal space,pressure is induced upon the spinal nerves.<br><br>
                Spondylolithesis; when one of the back bones slips forward and out of position.<br><br>
                Degenerative disc disease; when the discs in spinal cord gradually gets worn out.<br><br>
                Osteoarthritis; a wear-and-tear disease of bones.<br><br>
                Rheumatoid arthritis; an inflammatory condition of joints.<br><br>
                Carcinoma or benign tumors.<br><br>
                Kidney stones.<br><br>
                Endometriosis.<br><br>

                Avoid bed rest for extended periods as it might make low back pain worse <br> <br>
                Apply hot pack to the affected area if pain is chronic or cold packs if pain is acute. Traction for Back Pain – This has been the mainstay of treatment for back pain in the past. <br> <br>
                Electrical Stimulation:<br> <br>
                Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may help stop pain by blocking nerve signals from reaching your brain. A physical therapist places electrodes on your skin near the area of your pain. TENS may relieve pain in your leg due to inflammation or compression of nerves in your back.
                This treatment involves manipulation and massage of your spine and back muscles to relieve mild-to-moderate pain.<br> <br>
               Acupuncture:An acupuncturist inserts hair-thin needles under your skin. The needles usually stay in for 15 to 30 minutes. The insertion causes little or no pain. Expect to have several sessions. Research suggests pain relief may come from the release of endorphins, your body's natural painkillers.

                Cold is an illness that is short in duration, usually less than two weeks, does not usually produce fever, except in children. It is most prevalent among children, and seem to be related to youngsters' relative lack of resistance to infection and to contacts with other children in schools. The common cold causes irritation and drainage in any or all of the airways including the nose, sinuses, throat, voice box, and often the bronchial tubes.</div>
                  <div id="commoncold2" class="col s12">
                    Depending on the virus type, any or all of the following routes of transmission may be common:<br> <br>
                Touching infectious respiratory secretions on skin or personal objects which have been contaminated by the patient. <br> <br>
                Inhaling relatively large particles of respiratory secretions transported briefly in the air.<br> <br>
                Inhaling droplets, smaller infectious particles from coughing or sneezing by patients suffering from cold.

                Headache and body pain. <br> <br>
                Low grade fever (more likely in infants and young children).<br> <br>
                Green or yellow sputum or nasal secretions suggest a secondary bacterial infections of the middle ear or sinusitis requiring treatment with antibiotics. Cold symptoms can last from two to 14 days, but two-thirds of people recover in a week. If symptoms occur often or last much longer than two weeks, with high fever, significantly swollen glands, severe facial pain in the sinuses, and a cough that produces mucus, it indicates a complication or more serious illness requiring a doctor's attention.
                  </div>

             Infection of cold disappears within seven to ten days. Usually, common cold does not require any treatment. But, if the symptoms continue, or if certain pre-existing respiratory condition become worse, it indicates the involvement of bacteria in addition to the virus. In such condition antibiotics might have to be administrated to improve the condition. Only symptomatic treatment is available for uncomplicated cases of the common cold: bed rest, plenty of fluids, gargling with warm salt water, petroleum jelly for a raw nose, and aspirin or acetaminophen to relieve headache or fever.

              The disease occurs in two types: <br><br>
              <b>Type 1 diabetes:</b> This is the type of diabetes that generally affects young people and requires treatment with insulin.<br> <br>
              <b>Type 2 diabetes:</b> This type of diabetes generally develops after age 40. Diabetes can develop gradually, often without symptoms, over many years.</div>

                    <b>Type 1 Diabetes:</b><br><br> This type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Your immune system turns on itself and destroys the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas.It usually develops in childhood or teen years, it can appear later.<br><br>
                <b>Causes:</b><br><br>
                Viral or bacterial infection<br><br>
                Chemical toxins within food<br><br>
                <b>Type 2 Diabetes:</b> <br><br>In this type, your pancreas makes some insulin, but not enough. Your cells also can become resistant to insulin's effects, keeping insulin from escorting enough glucose into your body's cells.<br><br>

                Controlling blood sugar is the single most important thing you can do to prevent long-term complications of diabetes. <br> <br>
                For type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin. Today, most people use synthetic insulin, which is chemically identical to human insulin.<br> <br>
                If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to control your blood sugar with weight control, diet and exercise. Or, you may need to combine these approaches with medication.

                  <div id="epilepsy2" class="col s12">
                    Causes of epilepsy vary by age of the person. Some people with no clear cause of epilepsy may have a genetic cause. But what's true for every age is that the cause is unknown for about half of everyone with epilepsy.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Some people with no known cause of epilepsy may have a genetic form of epilepsy. One or more genes may cause the epilepsy or epilepsy may be caused by the way some genes work in the brain. The relationship between genes and seizures can be very complex and genetic testing is not available yet for many forms of epilepsy.</li> 
                      <li>About 3 out of 10 people have a change in the structure of their brains that causes the electrical storms of seizures.</li>
                      <li>Some young children may be born with a structural change in an area of the brain that gives rise to seizures. </li>
                      <li>About 3 out of 10 children with autism spectrum disorder may also have seizures. The exact cause and relationship is still not clear. </li>
                      <li>Infections of the brain are also common causes of epilepsy. The initial infections are treated with medication, but the infection can leave scarring on the brain that causes seizures at a later time. </li>
                      <li>People of all ages can have head injuries, though severe head injuries happen most often in young adults.</li>
                      <li>In middle age, strokes, tumors and injuries are more frequent.</li>
                      <li>In people over 65, stroke is the most common cause of new onset seizures. Other conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or other conditions that affect brain function can also cause seizures.</li>

                  <br>Influenza, commonly known as the "flu," is an extremely contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza A or B viruses. Flu appears most frequently in winter and early spring. The flu virus attacks the body by spreading through the upper and/or lower respiratory tract.</div>
                  <div id="flu2" class="col s12">
                    While more than 100 different viruses can cause a cold, only influenza virus types A, B, and C cause the flu.
                    <br><br>
                    Type A and B viruses cause the large seasonal outbreaks. Type C usually causes milder respiratory symptoms. While the flu vaccine can help protect you from types A and B, there is no immunization for type C virus.
                    <br><br>
                    Type A flu viruses are also found in many different animals, including ducks, chickens, pigs, whales, horses, and seals. Type B viruses only affect people.

                      <li>Severe aches in muscles and joints</li>

                    </ul>
                    Adults with seasonal flu don’t usually vomit or have diarrhea, but children might. Some symptoms can mean your illness is severe.

                     <li>Get Vaccinated</li>
                     <li>Build a Germ Barrier: Wash your hands with warm water and soap every time you shake hands or touch a surface that might be germ-covered.
                    Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you for times when you can’t get to a sink.
                    Bring along disinfectant wipes to clean any surfaces you're about to touch.
                    Take extra care to not touch your mouth, eyes, or nose without washing your hands first.</li>
                    <li>Take Care of Yourself: Eat a balanced diet.
                    Exercise at least 4 days a week.

                    Gout is a kind of arthritis. It can cause an attack of sudden burning pain, stiffness, and swelling in a joint, usually a big toe. These attacks can happen over and over unless gout is treated. Over time, they can harm your joints, tendons, and other tissues. Gout is most common in men.
                    <br><br>
                    Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood. Most of the time, having too much uric acid isn't harmful. Many people with high levels in their blood never get gout. But when uric acid levels in your blood are too high, the uric acid may form hard crystals in your joints.
                    <br><br>
                    Your chances of getting gout are higher if you are overweight, drink too much alcohol, or eat too much meat and fish that are high in chemicals called purines. Some medicines, such as water pills (diuretics), can also bring on gout.

If you suspect that someone has heat stroke -- also known as sunstroke -- call 911 immediately and give first aid until paramedics arrive.<br>
                  Heat stroke can kill or cause damage to the brain and other internal organs. Although heat stroke mainly affects people over age 50, it also takes a toll on healthy young athletes.<br>
                  Heat stroke often occurs as a progression from milder heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat syncope (fainting), and heat exhaustion. But it can strike even if you have no previous signs of heat injury.<br>
                  Heat stroke results from prolonged exposure to high temperatures -- usually in combination with dehydration -- which leads to failure of the body's temperature control system. The medical definition of heat stroke is a core body temperature greater than 105 degrees Fahrenheit, with complications involving the central nervous system that occur after exposure to high temperatures. Other common symptoms include nausea, seizures, confusion, disorientation, and sometimes loss of consciousness or coma.

                  <div id="heat_stroke2" class="col s12">
                  Heatstroke can occur as a result of:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Exposure to a hot environment. In a type of heatstroke, called nonexertional or classic heatstroke, being in a hot environment leads to a rise in body temperature. This type of heatstroke typically occurs after exposure to hot, humid weather, especially for prolonged periods, such as two or three days. It occurs most often in older adults and in people with chronic illness.</li>
                    <li>Strenuous activity. Exertional heatstroke is caused by an increase in body temperature brought on by intense physical activity in hot weather. Anyone exercising or working in hot weather can get exertional heatstroke, but it's most likely to occur if you're not used to high temperatures.</li>
                  </ul>
                  In either type of heatstroke, your condition can be brought on by:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Wearing excess clothing that prevents sweat from evaporating easily and cooling your body</li>
                    <li>Drinking alcohol, which can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature</li>
                    <li>Becoming dehydrated by not drinking enough water to replenish fluids lost through sweating </li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div id="heat_stroke3" class="col s12">
                    The hallmark symptom of heat stroke is a core body temperature above 105 degrees Fahrenheit. But fainting may be the first sign.

                      <li>Lack of sweating despite the heat</li>
                      <li>Red, hot, and dry skin</li>
                      <li>Muscle weakness or cramps</li>
                      <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                      <li>Rapid heartbeat, which may be either strong or weak</li>
                      <li>Rapid, shallow breathing</li>
                      <li>Behavioral changes such as confusion, disorientation, or staggering</li>
                      <li>Seizures</li>
                      <li>Unconsciousness</li>

                   When the heat index is high, it's best to stay in an air-conditioned environment. If you must go outdoors, you can prevent heat stroke by taking these steps:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and a wide-brimmed hat.</li>
                      <li>Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or more.</li>
                      <li>Drink extra fluids. To prevent dehydration, it's generally recommended to drink at least eight glasses of water, fruit juice, or vegetable juice per day. Because heat-related illness also can result from salt depletion, it may be advisable to substitute an electrolyte-rich sports drink for water during periods of extreme heat and humidity.</li>
                      <li>Take additional precautions when exercising or working outdoors.The general recommendation is to drink 24 ounces of fluid two hours before exercise, and consider adding another 8 ounces of water or sports drink right before exercise. During exercise, you should consume another 8 ounces of water every 20 minutes, even if you don't feel thirsty.</li>
                      <li>Reschedule or cancel outdoor activity. If possible, shift your time outdoors to the coolest times of the day, either early morning or after sunset.</li>
